		<h1>MicroUrb's Philosophy</h1>
		<p>Here at MicroUrb we guarantee you organically grown produce, because we grew it ourselves and we are local. We're not pompous, we're proud. We're proud of our work, our quality, our environment and our love for fresh local produce and family.</p>
		<p>Thank you, from your local urban family farm.</p>
